🚀 Project Space

Project Space is a computer graphics project that simulates a journey from Earth to outer space and landing on the moon. It features multiple animated scenes, interactive controls, and smooth transitions between different stages of space exploration.

🌌 Features

Multiple Scenes :

Scene 1 (Intro): Animated stars and circles with project title.

Scene 2 (City Launchpad): Daytime environment with sun, clouds, roads, buses, trees, buildings, and a rocket on the launchpad. 

Scene 3 (Rocket Launch): Space environment with rockets, clouds, stars, and meteors. Dual rocket launches with animation timing.

Scene 4 (Deep Space): Dark space with stars, planets (Earth, Mars, Venus), satellites, meteors, and rockets traveling.

Scene 5 (Moon Landing): Astronauts planting flags (Bangladesh & AIUB), stairs setup, and rocket landing on the moon surface.


Dynamic Animations:

1.Rocket launches, stops, and reverses.
2.Moving buses.
3.Drifting clouds. 
4.Falling meteors. 
5.Rotating Earth.

Keyboard Controls (Scene-Specific):

🔹(Rockets – Scene 1)

j: Rocket fast forward

l: Rocket slow forward

k: Rocket stop

;: Rocket backward

🔹(Scene 2 – City Launchpad)

v: Start clouds + bus movement

b: Stop clouds + bus

n: Rocket launch upward

m: Stop rocket

🔹(Scene 3 – Rocket + Meteors)

t: Rocket forward/up

u: Rocket backward/down

y: Rocket stop

Meteors auto-start after ~25s

🔹(Scene 4 – Dual Rockets + Meteors)

w: Both rockets upward

s: First rocket downward

a: Second rocket downward

d: Stop both rockets

Meteors auto-start after ~30s

🔹(Scene 5 – Moon Landing)

⬆️ Up Arrow: Increase rocket speed

⬇️ Down Arrow: Stop rocket

⬅️ Left Arrow: Move stairs & astronauts

➡️ Right Arrow: Stop stairs & astronauts

Meteors auto-start after ~40s


⭐ Why This Project is Special

1.Combines multiple space exploration stages into one interactive project.

2.Features team-based modular design, each contributor working on specific parts.

3.Smooth animation & keyboard interaction for a realistic simulation.

4.Represents Bangladesh in space with a national flag planted on the moon.
